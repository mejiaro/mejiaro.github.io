<p>Jekyll is a powerful templating language, it's fairly easy to setup and after your site has been generated it's free to host on Github Pages.</p>
<p>You can find get the code on how this site was built <a href="https://github.com/mejiaro/mejiaro.github.io">here</a> and the official Jekyll documentation <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/">here</a>. The docs are great, and in case there was a little too much magic Google was always there to help.</p>	
<p>Happy coding.</p>
