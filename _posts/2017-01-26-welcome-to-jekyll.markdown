<p>Jekyll is a powerful templating language, it's fairly easy to setup and after your site has been generated you can host it for free on Github Pages.</p>
<p>You can find get the code on how I built this site <a href="https://github.com/mejiaro/mejiaro.github.io">here</a>, and the official Jekyll documentation <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/">here</a>. The docs are great, and in case there was a little too much magic going on Google was always there to help.</p>	
<p>Happy coding.</p>
