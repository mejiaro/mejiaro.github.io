title: "Multiplaza"
description: "Built with Ruby on Rails, this has been one of the most interesting projects I've worked on. Through user interaction it feeds a recommendation system that tailors the content on the site to the user's liking. A user who has a healthy lifestyle would get recommendations on sports stores sales, healthy eating, etc. Additionally, it integrates promotions, blog posts, and information from stores of 7 malls in 5 different countries."
